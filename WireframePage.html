      <li>Our teams creative thinking process was to create a vision of what the website will look like first and then create it. We talked about what we wanted it to look like and planned out the visuals of the webpage .</li>
      <br>
      <li>We distributed the work by assigning each group member a webpage to make about the article they read. Since there was 3 articles, we each made a webpage about the articles. Also, there was one person that was in charge of making sure all the code was written correctly and that everything works properly. </li>
      <br>
      <li>Our team feels the most proud of how the homepage looks nice and how the images bounce which I think is cool. </li>
      <br>
      <li>The task that we found most difficult was adding the links and getting the images where we want them to be.</li>
